# CPPND: Memory Management Chatbot

This is the project for the third course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Memory Management. The original repo can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot
)

The ChatBot code creates a dialogue where users can ask questions about some aspects of memory management in C++. After the knowledge base of the chatbot has been loaded from a text file, a knowledge graph representation is created in computer memory, where chatbot answers represent the graph nodes and user queries represent the graph edges. After a user query has been sent to the chatbot, the Levenshtein distance is used to identify the most probable answer. The starter code was fully functional but only used raw pointers to represent the knowledge graph and interconnections between objects throughout the project.

In this project the goal was to analyze and modify the program. Advanced concepts like smart pointers, move semantics and the rule of five for proper memory allocation were applied. By doing so, the memory management of the program was significantly improved to prevent data leaks and the overall performance was increased by reducing time- and resource-heavy operations.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.11
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* wxWidgets >= 3.0
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev libwxgtk3.0-0v5`. If you are facing unmet dependency issues, refer to the [official page](https://wiki.codelite.org/pmwiki.php/Main/WxWidgets30Binaries#toc2) for installing the unmet dependencies.
  * Mac: There is a [homebrew installation available](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/wxmac).
  * Installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Install). Some version numbers may need to be changed in instructions to install v3.0 or greater.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./membot`.

## Future Increase in Knowledge-Base
As stated above, the ChatBot program initializes its knowledge graph upon running from the `./src/answergraph.txt` file. By adding graph nodes and edges to this file, the knowledge base can be arbitrarily expanded to feature different topics, levels of details or connections. No change to the code is necessary. However, it is to be made sure that the answer graph has only one root node and features no circular edges.
